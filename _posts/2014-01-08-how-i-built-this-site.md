Yes, I used Jekyll to build this site. If you haven't used a static web generator to create a website before then here is one for you to try. 

###Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a blog aware static web generator which allows you to publish and maintain a blog by simply managing a folder of text files. It is simple to use and does not require any databases, complex javascript or HTML manipulation. It uses Markdown which is a simple text-toHTML conversion tool and the Liquid templating engine. if you use git hub to store your precious code then you are already familiar with Markdown syntax. Remember the Readme.md files that get automatically generated for you when you create a new repository in github?
