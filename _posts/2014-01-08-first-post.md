###This is my personal blog for matters relating to software development. Over the years, I have worked on multiple large scale software projects for various institutions and research organizations and finally got to work on sharing my experiences and thoughts.
I welcome your comments, contributions and suggestions.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/) for providing the theme for this site. Check out his site for some cool Responsive themes for Jekyll.


### Stay tuned...
